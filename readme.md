# "WORD SPRINT"

Quite simply, a **typing game**. Using HTML/CSS/JS in combination with a word API to populate random words for you to race against! This is a timed game where you type words you see on the screen. Every game is 60 seconds long.

## Features
**Type & See:** This is a visual game as much as it's a logical game. As you type a letter of the word, if the letter is correct in the correct order, the background of the letter will turn green. If the word is wrong, the background color of the word will turn orange.
**Score:** Each word typed correctly will add to the score by one. 

## Stretch Goals
**Difficulty Slider:** A drop-down will exist on the page where you can select the difficulty of the words to type. More difficult words will generally be longer strings, along with words that aren't used on a day-to-day basis that would make it hard for a player to know how to spell something off the top of their head. 
**Accuracy Game:** Using much of the same game principals, if words are typed correctly consecutively, a score multiplier appears on the screen and gets bigger & more serious as more words are typed correctly in a row. This will also change the scoring system as each word typed correctly will multiply the base score (+1) by a factor of 0.1. So (1.1x, 1.2x, 1.3x... onward.)
